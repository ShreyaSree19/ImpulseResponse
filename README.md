# ImpulseResponseDB
A free database of impulse responses for phones and small devices.

Though many databases of room impulse responses exist, there are no free or publically avialable datasets for device impulse responses. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a free database of impulse responses for phones and other small devices (Iphones, Androids, Ipads, etc.) 

# Methodology
A swept sine wave signal was played through a speaker with a negigible impulse response. Factors such as optimal recording distances and times were determined through small experiments. The signal was then recorded in a noise-canceling room using different devices. Finally, the recordings were processed and the device impulse responses were extracted using MATLAB.

# ImpulseResponses
The impulse responses are provided as MATLAB Figures. The Recordings are labeled IR_Identifier_PhoneType_RecordingNumber. The PhoneType typically has IP for IPhone or SS for Samsung, otherwise the names are fully written out.
